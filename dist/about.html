          <p>
            Born in Mannheim, I've studied Applied Computer Sience in Heidelberg
            at the Karls-Ruprecht University. I've been coding since 2013,
            starting with C++ and Java. While studying, I've discovered my
            passion for agile Development and got to learn various
            Software-Engineering concepts. Working in a team, having reviews has
            periodically been in my eyes the right way to develop good and
            sustainable software. Topics like Containerization, CI/CD are
            currently my favorite topics since I'm working to get more into
            DevOps.

          <p>
            A study showed: Developers are capable of adding Feature-Tags to
            their Code thus 35% of the code is still untagged. Supporting
            Developers in tagging their Code, I've developed an automated tool
            which uses structural and textual code analysis to tag untagged code
            parts with their corresponding tag.

            Me and 5 other students got the chance to develop the prototype for
            the Master-Patient Index App for "Zentrum für Informations- und
            Medizintechnik" in Heidelberg. This internship included requirement
            engineering, stakeholder meetings, development, testing, quality
            control and release. We've used SCRUM and the prototype was finished
            after 9 weeks (9 sprints). MongoDB - Node.JS - React
